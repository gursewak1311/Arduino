  Description:  taking two buttons that move the servo motor
  				by 25%. one button moves it forward but when 
                the motor hits 100% again pressing button one
                will make the motor rotate back to 0%. Same will
                happen with second button but the motor will move 
                backwards and will move to 100% when button is 
                hit at 0%.
                As the motor rotates the RGB will also show
                different colors*/
